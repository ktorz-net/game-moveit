# Iterative Development

Agile Development ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development))
Borns with a Manifesto (Beck et all. 2021) focusing development over $4$ values:

- **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
- **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
- **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
- **Responding to change** over _following a plan_

We can extract severals lessons:

1. Project Development is not an exact science.
2. It sound like an utopia but it's seek for efficiency.
3. Development rythmed with iterations seems to be a good idea.

## Example with Scrum 

It is one implementation of Agile methode. It introduces notions as:

- Daily Scrum metting - or Standup meetting (team activity)
- Sprint (temporal decomposition)
- Product backlog / sprint backlog (object)
- Srum Master (Role)

![](./resources/Scrum_process.svg)

It highligts Agile Development with _iterative process_ as the core element of the method.
But, a strong usage of _Scrum_ can put _processes and tools_ before **Individuals and interactions**.

## What do we need

- A solution
